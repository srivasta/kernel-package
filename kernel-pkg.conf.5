.SH NAME
kernel\-pkg.conf \- site wide configuration file for make\-kpkg
.SH SYNOPSIS
.I /etc/kernel\-pkg.conf
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
The file 
.I /etc/kernel\-pkg.conf
is actually a 
.BR Makefile
snippet included during the kernel packages build process, and hence
you may put any legal Makefile directive in that file (just make very
sure you know what you are doing).  
.PP
All the variables have reasonable default values, and maybe
over\-ridden on a per run or a per individual basis by using
environment variables.  Some of the variables can further be
over\-ridden by options to 
.B make\-kpkg.
.PP
At the moment, the user modifiable variables supported are:
.TP
.B maintainer:     
Local kernel-* package maintainer. Set up at package installation by
the 
.IR postinst.
Can be over\-ridden by the environment variable 
.B KPKG_MAINTAINER.
.TP
.B email:          
The email address of that person.  Set up at package installation by
the 
.IR postinst.
Can be over\-ridden by the environment variable 
.B KPKG_EMAIL.
.TP
.B pgp:            
Name to search for in the pgp database 
.BI iff
separate modules (like pcmcia etc) are being built in
.IR /usr/src/modules/.
Can be over\-ridden by the environment variable 
.B PGP_SIGNATURE, 
and is over\-ridden (again) by the 
.IR \-\-pgpsign
option of
.B make-kpkg.
Defaults to 
.I maintainer.
(Optional)
.TP
.B debian:         
The Debian revision of the kernel packages. Can be over\-ridden
by the environment variable 
.B DEBIAN_REVISION, 
and is over\-ridden (again) by the 
.IR \-\-revision
option of
.B make-kpkg.
Defaults to 
.I 1.00.
(Optional)
.TP
.B image_in_boot:  
Set to True if you want the kernel image 
.I vmlinuz 
and
.I System.map 
in 
.I /boot 
rather than the default 
.I /.  
Can be over\-ridden by the environment variable
.B IMAGE_IN_BOOT. 
defaults to undefined.
(Optional)
.TP
.B kimage:         
The kernel image type (i.e. zImage or bzImage). Can be
over\-ridden from the environment variable 
.B IMAGE_TYPE,  
and is over\-ridden (again) by the options
.IR \-\-zimage
or
.IR \-\-bzimage
of
.B make-kpkg.
Defaults to 
.I bzImage.
(Optional)
.PP
The value of a variable can be set so:
.IP a)
Defaults exist in the rules file. These are the values used if no
customization is done.
.IP b)
Variables can be set in the config file 
.I /etc/kernel-pkg.conf. 
These values over ride the defaults.
.IP c)
Variables can also be set by setting a corresponding envirnment
variable.  These values over ride the config file and the defaults.
.IP d)
Using 
.B make-kpkg 
options, or, if using the rules file directly, on 
command line 
.br
.BI "# xxx/rules DEBIAN_REVISION=2.0a kernel_image"
.br
This over rides all the above methods.
.SH FILES
The file described here is
.I /etc/kernel-pkg.conf.
.SH "SEE ALSO"

.BR make (1),
.B The GNU Make manual.
.SH BUGS
There are no bugs.  Any resemblance thereof is delirium. Really.
